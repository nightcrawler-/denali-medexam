## Contribuion/Usage

### Setup

#### Install Ruby

The first step is to install dependencies for Ruby on Rails

```
sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs yarn
```
Install `rbenv`

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL
```
Then install `ruby-build`

```

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

rbenv install 2.7.0
rbenv global 2.7.0
ruby -v
```

Finally

```
gem install bundler
```

#### Install Rails

```
gem install rails -v 6.0.2.1

rbenv rehash
```

#### Setting Up PostgreSQL

Add a new repo to get the most recent version of pg (optional)

```
sudo apt install postgresql-11 libpq-dev
```
Create and user and set an optional password

```
sudo -u postgres createuser frederick -s

# If you would like to set a password for the user, you can do the following
sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# \password frederick

```

##### The below are for creating a new rails app

```
#### If you want to use Postgres
# Note that this will expect a postgres user with the same username
# as your app, you may need to edit config/database.yml to match the
# user you created earlier
rails new myapp -d postgresql

# Move into the application directory
cd myapp

# If you setup MySQL or Postgres with a username/password, modify the
# config/database.yml file to contain the username/password that you specified

# Create the database
rake db:create

#You might encouter a db creation permissions related issue at this point, do the following:
sudo -u postgres psql
postgres=# alter user frederick createdb;

rails db:migrate

rails server
```

### Misc

In the event you need to drop and recreate the db but access is disabled due to other users, force restart postgres `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`

### Deployment to heroku

For some strange reason, one of the dev/test groups gems, rspec, plus swagger etc had issues living out of thier groups so they had to be moved to production, no biggie but not advised.

Now, setting up things on heroku should be quite straight forward -- get account, link to github and project etc.

You'll need to set up the heroku CLI on your development machine, the guide is pretty clear on the steps. If you choose to deploy your app automatically for certain branches, easy. But for the first deployment, you need to perfom your db:migrate and db:seed tasks from the heroku CLI: `heroku run db:migrate -a your-app`

###

After deployment, user sign up is currently open, however, to gain full control, use the rails console to assign your user the admin role. `User.find(:id, email whatever) then x.add_role :admin`
